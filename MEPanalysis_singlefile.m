% this script allows you to automatically process an EMG trace and extract
% the MEP size (peak to peak and area under the curve), the MEP onset
% latency using two different methods, and the EMG activity preceding the
% TMS pulse, which can be useful to exclude MEPs preceded by excessive
% muscular contraction.
